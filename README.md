Release Notes
WaveMaker 00.06 includes the following features:

WaveMaker renders abstract graphics in real-time using a combination of parameters that determine curve shape,
line characteristics and color. Because the curve shape itself is randomly generated, no two renderings will ever
be exactly the same.

This version runs on page load, and does not include a GUI for parameter control.

Known Issues:

1. IE9 AND LOWER NOT SUPPORTED
Not so much an issue as a statement of fact.  Not going to change.

2. IE10 PERFORMANCE 
WaveMaker has not been optimized for IE10, and runs extremely slow. We recommend using Chrome (PC/Mac), 
Firefox (PC/Mac), or Safari (Mac) for best results.

NOT OPTIMIZED FOR MOBILE DEVICES
It may run, but it will be very slow.

NO STATE MAINTAINANCE
Be aware that if you navigate away from the main page while rendering, the process is killed, 
and the graphic is lost.
